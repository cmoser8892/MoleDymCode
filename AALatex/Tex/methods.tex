goals of a md simulation

	-> From the dirivation of the potential energy we can get the forces

- disciticed in time

\end{comment}
The goal of a molecular dynamics simulation is to determine the motion of each individual atom. For this we have to solve the equations of motion and compute the forces that affect each atom.
\begin{equation}
	\label{potentialForceEquation}
	\overrightarrow{f_{k}} = -\cfrac{\displaystyle\partial}{\displaystyle \partial \overrightarrow{r_{k}}} E_{pot}(\{\overrightarrow{r_{k}}\}) 
\end{equation}
The forces can be derived from the potential Energy as shown in \ref{potentialForceEquation} \cite[cf.][]{molDymCourse}. 


\section{Integration}
\begin{comment}
- obtain force from the previous equation
- dirivation in v. r.. from the mass
- system can be discribed just by the velocity and postion of each atom
- in the simulation the positions and velocities of the individual atoms have to be tracked and updated accordingly
- most used  is the Velocity-Verlet Algorithm
\end{comment}
From the equation \ref{potentialForceEquation} we can obtain the force at each individual atom with it's acceleration, velocity and position as shown in  \ref{potentialForceEquationForEachAtom}. 
\begin{equation}
	\label{potentialForceEquationForEachAtom}
	\overrightarrow{f_{i}} = \cfrac{\displaystyle\partial E_{pot}}{\displaystyle \partial \overrightarrow{r_{i}}} = m_{i}\overrightarrow{a_{i}} = m_{i}\overrightarrow{\dot{v_{i}}} = m_{i}\overrightarrow{\ddot{r_{i}}}
\end{equation}
It can be seen that the system can be described just by the velocities and positions of the atoms. 
In the implementation we hold these values in an container-class to ensure that they are consecutive in  memory. This speeds up the simulation.

%to porpagate
In the next step we need to somehow propagate the simulation forward in time as a static simulation would be rather boring. For updating the positions and velocities one of the most used algorithm is the Velocity-Verlet integration. 
This scheme is often split up into two steps, the prediction shown in the equations \ref{verletPrediction1} and \ref{verletPrediction2} and the correction shown in equation \ref{verletCorrection} \cite[cf. ][]{molDymCourse}. In between the two steps the force can be updated. 
%Verlet steps
\begin{equation}
	\label{verletPrediction1}
	\overrightarrow{v_{i}}(t+\Delta t/2) = 
	\overrightarrow{v_{i}}(t) + 
	\frac{\overrightarrow{f_{i}}(t)\Delta t}{2m_{i}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	\label{verletPrediction2}
	\overrightarrow{r_{i}}(t+\Delta t) = 
	\overrightarrow{r_{i}}(t) + \overrightarrow{v_{i}}(t + \Delta t/2)\Delta t
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	\label{verletCorrection}
	\overrightarrow{v_{i}}(t+\Delta t) = \overrightarrow{v_{i}}(t+\Delta t/2) +
	\frac{\overrightarrow{f_{i}}(t + \Delta t)\Delta t}{2m_{i}}
\end{equation}
We could now already propagate atoms forward with a constant force, so next we have to actually model the forces affecting each atom.


\section{Lenard-Jones-Potential}
\begin{comment}
- pair potential
\end{comment}
%General Formula for the dirivation
The Lenard-Jones potential is most likely one of the more famous pair potentials. The goal of them is to model the Coulomb force and the Pauli repulsion. 
\begin{equation}
	V(r) = 4\epsilon\bigg[\Big(\frac{\sigma}{r}\Big)^{12}- \Big(\frac{\sigma}{r}\Big)^{6} \bigg]
\end{equation}
As shown in \ref{potentialForceEquation} we can derive the forces from the potential Energy. Now we have to formulate the equation for each atom, this was done in \ref {potentialEquationAtoms}. We can get the force at the atom, if we get sum up the derivative of the potential energy between atom k and all the other atoms i times the normed vector between them. 
\begin{equation}
	\label{potentialEquationAtoms}
	\overrightarrow{f_{k}} = -\frac{\partial E_{pot}}{\partial  \overrightarrow{r_{k}}}=\sum_{i}^{}\frac{\partial V}{\partial r_{ik}} \hat{r_{ik}}
\end{equation}
%Formulation of the lj potential
To actually implement the equation we have to actually derive $\delta V/ \delta r_{ik}$ analytically. This could have been done by hand, but was actually just done with python.

With the codesnippet from above the derivative of the potential, shown in the next equation \ref{potentialEquationAtomsDirivative}, was obtained.
\begin{equation}
	\label{potentialEquationAtomsDirivative}
	\frac{\partial V}{\partial r} = 4 \epsilon \left(\frac{6 \sigma^{6}}{r^{7}} - \frac{12 \sigma^{12}}{r^{13}}\right)
\end{equation}
Now we can implement those last two equations. We can even optimize it by subtracting the force that affects atom k from the forces of atom i, as they have to be the same just with opposite direction and therefore sign.
