\begin{comment}
- give look at stuff i did and did not
- mention all the other cool stuff, parralell hardware memes domain decompasition looking at other mechanical parameters ia stress
- should be written nice if i wanna work with those guys
-btw the github is actually hilarious although a c++ project over 80% is jupyther and other stuff lol
