\begin{comment}
- give look at stuff i did and did not
- mention all the other cool stuff, parralell hardware memes domain decompasition looking at other mechanical parameters ia stress
- should be written nice if i wanna work with those guys
-btw the github is actually hilarious although a c++ project over 80% is jupyther and other stuff lol 
- personal ?!

Over the duration of the course we dove into a very interesting mix between chemistry, physics and programming. We were also able to look at different methods for simulating liquids and solids. It would also have been interesting to look further into dividing the program via domain decomposition and utilize the modern parallel computer-architectures in a better way.
