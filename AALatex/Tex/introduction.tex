\chapter{Introduction}
\begin{comment}
- mention like the goal of this 
- introduction to md simulation 
- weird mix between chemistry, physics and computation + a lot of programming
- written in c++ instead of the standard python stuff (by now)
- from a developers perspective programming in python will most likely take less time, while programming in be a bit faster (and more complicated)
